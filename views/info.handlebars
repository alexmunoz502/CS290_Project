                        <p>Australian Shepherds are descendants of the Pyrenean Shepherd, a herding dog from the Pyrenees Mountains between France and Spain. There, the indigenous Basques people trained these dogs to herd their sheep and cattle.</p>
                        <p>In the early 1800s, many Basques sailed east to Australia to build pastures, bringing their shepherd dogs with them. It was during this time that the breed was mixed with Collies and Border Collies, bringing the Aussie closer to its modern-day appearance and temperament.</p>
                        <p>The Basques people eventually set sail again, bringing the breed to California. Since the Basques came from Australia, the American ranchers believed the dogs were Australian by nature. This is how they received their name today. </p>
                        <p>The breed was officially welcomed to the AKC in 1993. Aussies are still used as ranching and herding dogs, as well as trained to be service dogs.</p>
